# AccentureFizzBuzz
This is my implementation of the requested FizzBuzz API.

We should be good to run under any Visual Studio IDE that accepts .NET 7 
VS 2022 Preferred.

We can use the applications ENDPOINTS by running the AccentureFizzBuzz project.
Make sure your IDE is set to run under IIS Express for better visualization

Unit Testing was developed in NUNIT
Make Sure to Run TEST under the Text Explorer
Which can be brought up with Ctrl+E,T

This will open a view in which you can look at the Unit Testing Methods applied
